You seem to be the only guy ON INTERNET who doesn't take anything for granted and actually explains every single aspect of the programming language with knowledge and clarity. Most people don't understand that even the smallest insignificant detail could be very confusing for a neophyte if they don't explain what it does and why it behaves that way. Thanks for going so in depth on each topic!");
